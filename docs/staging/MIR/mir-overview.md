# Main Inclusion Review (MIR) process

Packages in Ubuntu {term}`main` (and {term}`restricted`) are officially
maintained, supported and recommended by the Ubuntu project.
{term}`Canonical` provides security updates, standard support services, and
certain {term}`SLA` guarantees for these packages.

Therefore, special consideration is necessary before adding new packages
to `main` or `restricted`. The [Ubuntu MIR team](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mir)
reviews packages for promotion:

* from {term}`universe` to `main`.
* from {term}`multiverse` to `restricted`.

The process of reviewing packages before they can be promoted is the
**Main Inclusion Review (MIR)** process.

## The MIR documentation

The guidelines and review process is constantly evolving. Even if you have
submitted a package for Main Inclusion Review in the past, you should still
re-read the MIR documentation.

The MIR documentation is also a living document. External contributions,
suggestions, discussions or questions about the process are always welcome. We
would love to hear from you!

To contribute, simply submit a pull request with your changes or create an
issue as described in our {ref}`Contributing guide<contribute>`. Please
also attend the weekly {ref}`MIR Team meeting <mir-team-meeting>` if you want
to discuss your issue with the MIR Team.
